In ES6, functions can take default arguments:

```js
function sayHello(greeting = "Hello", name = "CampJS") {
    console.log(`${greeting} ${name}!`);
}
```

When you call the function without arguments in those positions, the default
ones are applied instead:

```js
sayHello();            // "Hello CampJS!"
sayHello("Hi there");  // "Hi there CampJS!"
```

You can also use `undefined` in any argument position to trigger the default:

```js
sayHello(undefined, undefined); // "Hello CampJS!"
sayHello("Hiya", undefined);    // "Hiya CampJS!"
sayHello(undefined, "JSConf");  // "Hello JSConf!"
```

Note that other values will *not* trigger the defaulting, even falsy values
like `null`, `false`, `""`, or `0`:

```js
sayHello(null, 0); // "null 0!"
```

## Challenge

As in the **rest** parameters exercise, your goal is to write a Node module
whose default export is a function.  This time it will take two arguments:
a lower bound and an upper bound.  Your function should return the midpoint
between those two bounds.

However, your function should have sensible defaults.  The lower bound should
default to `0`, and the upper bound should default to `1`.

As before, you don't need to print anything to the console.
Your solution should look something like:

```js
module.exports = function midpoint(/* what goes here */) {
    // what goes here?
};
```

We'll test your module by passing it a few different sets of arguments:
sometimes none, sometimes one, sometimes two.  Sometimes we'll pass in
an explicit `undefined`, and you should be sure to treat that as the
default.
