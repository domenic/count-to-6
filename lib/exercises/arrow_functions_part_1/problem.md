Arrow functions are one of the most fun new features of ES6.

In this exercise, we'll focus on one of the most common usage of arrow functions:
shortening very simple functions. In ES6, you can write an arrow function like:

```js
x => x + 1
```

and that means the same thing as the ES5 code:

```js
function (x) { return x + 1; }
```

Very nice, yes?  You can put any expression on the right-hand side of the `=>`,
and it will become the return value. This is especially useful when performing
operations like `map` or `filter` on arrays.

Note that if you need multiple arguments, you'll need to wrap them in
parentheses, like so:

```js
(x, y) => x + y
```

## Challenge

You'll be given a variable number of arguments (`process.argv[2]` onward) to your
program, all of which will be strings. Use arrow functions to perform a map-reduce
operation over them, before outputting them to the console. That is, your solution
should start with something like:

```js
var inputs = process.argv.slice(2);
var result = inputs.map(/* what goes here? */)
                    .reduce(/* what goes here? */);
```

In particular, you should:

- Map all incoming strings to their first character
- Reduce the result by concatenating them together

So an input of `["Hello", "arrow", "functions"]` would become `"Haf"`.

To show your work, you should output the transformation to the console.
The above example would be:

```
[Hello,arrow,functions] becomes "Haf"
```
